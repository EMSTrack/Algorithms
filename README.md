# Ambulance Dispatch Simulation

A library to do ambulance dispatch simulation and analysis. Configurations such as number
 and placement of ambulances, case frequencies, and travel times results create different
  scenarios. These scenarios result in different outcomes, which allow for analysis.  

# Installation

See [Installation Instructions](docs/INSTALL.md).

# Learning how to run the simulator

See [Instructions for Running the Simulator](docs/RUN.md)

# Custom Simulation

- To run a custom simulation, create a new YAML file or copy an existing one. 

- Specify the requirements for the simulation (look to the other YAMLs for an example). Additional extensions for the framework can also be specified here.
